                                    As the industry’s first index fund for individual investors, \
                                    the Calibre Index Fund is a low-cost way to gain diversified exposure \
                                    to the U.S. equity market. The fund offers exposure to 500 of the \
                                    largest U.S. companies, which span many different industries and \
                                    account for about three-fourths of the U.S. stock market’s value. \
                                    The key risk for the fund is the volatility that comes with its full \
                                    exposure to the stock market. Because the Calibre Index Fund is broadly \
                                    diversified within the large-capitalization market, it may be \
                                    considered a core equity holding in a portfolio.",
