# Milk Production, Disposition, and Income [2018] Summary
## [May] [2019]
defining the tidy-data requirements for this report

## data
- contains all the data objects that should be available for a user
    - you'll note there is A LOT of scemantic-redundancy as the same data is "prepared" in various formats to maximize efficiency and accessibility for users.
    - if memory-bloat becomes a concern we can discuss "on-demand" ETL processes
    - But _how_ we make all of the data available to the user is not the question I'm trying to answer here. I'm just trying to show _what_ should be available to the user.
        - (we can, add or subtract objects as we move forward)
